                        Formerly known as Ethereal, Wireshark is open-source network 
                        software that can efficiently analyze network protocols and enhance 
                        security in real-time. Since it is a console-based password auditing 
                        and packet sniffer tool, you can use this security software to sniff 
                        the network and monitor your network traffic in real-time. Security 
                        professionals use this efficient software to capture data packets and 
                        inspect the features that particular data packets exhibit, which further 
                        helps to identify the weaknesses in network security.

                <p>
                    Professionals use John the Ripper for testing password strength.
                     This tool can quickly look for complex ciphers, encrypted logins,
                      hash-type passwords and identify weak passwords, which can be a
